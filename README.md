# Web-based XMPP Realtime Chat Client
This web-based Chatsystem is using the XMPP-Protocol to communicate with a Server (ORACLE Virtual Box & Openfire). 
Therefore the Javascript Library 'strophe.js' has been used to enable web-based Realtime-XMPP Applications.
You can:
- Send/Receive Text Messages
- Change your current Status
- Get the Status of other Users
- Send Contact Requests
- Lists your Contacts (Roster)
- Enter/Exit Group Chats
## Installation
